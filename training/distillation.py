# Detailed explanation
"""
DistillationTrainer is a specialized training class provided by the SetFit library, designed specifically 
for the process of model distillation. Model distillation is a technique where a smaller, less complex "student" 
model learns to replicate the performance of a larger, more complex "teacher" model. This approach is commonly 
used to create models that are more efficient and faster at inference while retaining much of the performance 
of the original model.

Typically, distillation involves a combination of a traditional loss function (like cross-entropy) to measure 
the accuracy of the student model on the ground truth labels, and a distillation loss, which measures how well 
the student model's outputs match those of the teacher model. The common choice is the Kullback-Leibler divergence 
for the distillation loss.

In the distillation process, temperature scaling is often used during the computation of the softmax function 
to smooth out the probabilities and make the outputs from the teacher model softer. This helps the student model 
to learn more generalized features rather than mimicking hard probabilities.
